HOW TO USE: Use these code examples as a guideline for formatting your HTML email. You may want to create your own template based on these snippets or just pick and choose the ones that fix your specific rendering issue(s). There are two main areas in the template: 1. The header (head) area of the document. You will find global styles, where indicated, to move inline. 2. The body section contains more specific fixes and guidance to use where needed in your design.

DO NOT COPY OVER COMMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS WITH THE CODE to your message or risk spam box banishment :).

It is important to note that sometimes the styles in the header area should not be or don't need to be brought inline. Those instances will be marked accordingly in the comments.

<!-- Using the xHTML doctype is a good practice when sending HTML email. While not the only doctype you can use, it seems to have the least inconsistencies. For more information on which one may work best for you, check out the resources below.

    /** Yahoo paragraph fix: removes the proper spacing or the paragraph (p) tag. To correct we set the top/bottom margin to 1em in the head of the document. Simple fix with little effect on other styling. You do not need to move this inline. NOTE: It is also common to use two breaks instead of the paragraph tag but I think this way is cleaner and more semantic. NOTE: This example recommends 1em or 1.12 em.

       /** BONUS: Adaptation of Brian Thies (Campaign Monitor) link color fix to render the Yahoo Short Cuts invisible. Yahoo short cuts are links that Yahoo places over certain text in your email without your knowledge.  In order to use this fix you need to make the text color the same of the actual font color of your email and reset a few elements. IMPORTANT: You then need to use the Responsys/Smith Harmon link color fix if you want to style your links to the color you want them to be.  If you don't, this fix will change all links to black in Yahoo.  
       
       If you are not worried about Yahoo's shorcuts, just remove this code.  This is not applicable for Yahoo Classic.
